The Egyptian fruit bat or Egyptian rousette (Rousettus aegyptiacus) is a species of megabat that is found in Africa, the Middle East, the Mediterranean, and the Indian subcontinent.

Egyptian fruit bats are social mammals which use rich vocal communication, and have been found to possess the capability of vocal learning. They are social animals who nearly exclusively interact with each other in the dark using versatile vocal skills. This makes them particularly interesting for bioacoustic research.

Egyptian fruit bats live in colonies of dozens to thousands and may live to the age of 25 or more.

## Dataset information

We provide two datasets - the Egyptian fruit bat dataset (91 080 recordings, unbalanced classes, 44GB), and its smaller, cleaner counterpart (10 000 recordings, 1 000 recordings per class, 4,9GB).

Vocalizations have been recorded at 250 000 Hz. Recordings range in length from 0.02 to 34 seconds. The calls are labeled and include the following information: emitter, addressee, context, emitter re-vocalization action, addressee pre-vocalization action, emitter post-vocalization action, and addressee post-vocalization action. The contains social vocalizations and represents the complete vocal repertoire used by the bats.

The preprocessed dataset can be downloaded from [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/egyptian_fruit_bats_202102). Here are the steps we took to preprocess the dataset. Here are the download instructions.

The zip file for this dataset is 44GB.

### The Egyptian fruit bat dataset 10k (smaller counterpart)

This is a smaller, cleaner version of the dataset above. It consists of only labels assigned with high confidence and centers on emitters. It included 1000 calls per emitter.

The dataset can be found on Internet Archive [here](https://archive.org/details/egyptian_fruit_bats_10k).

### Original, unprocessed dataset

The original dataset has been shared by Yossi Yovel et al. as part of the [An annotated dataset of Egyptian fruit bat vocalizations across varying contexts and during vocal ontogeny](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017143) paper. The full dataset is available for download [here](https://figshare.com/collections/An_annotated_dataset_of_Egyptian_fruit_bat_vocalizations_across_varying_contexts_and_during_vocal_ontogeny/3666502) (on top of the labeled portion we provide, it also contains over 200 000 of unnanotated recordings).
