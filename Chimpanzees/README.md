The [chimpanzee <em>(Pan troglodytes)</em>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee) is a [great ape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae) and a member of the genus [<em>Pan</em>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(genus)). Chimpanzees are one of the two closest living relatives of humans <em>Homo sapiens</em>. They inhabit forests and savannahs of tropical Africa.

## Dataset information
The dataset consists of raw audio recordings of chimpanzee vocalizations recorded by Hashim Issa Salala and Nasibu Zuberi Madumbi in Gombe National Park, Tanzania during August 2016- December 2017. The recordings come from two neighboring communities of chimpanzees at Gombe: Kasekela and Mitumba. Files contain a variety of different call-types, some known and some unknown. Data on the caller ID, caller action, context of recording, and call-types are included whenever available. Additionally, age and sex of individual chimpanzees are included in the metadata.

Recordings were obtained using Sennheiser ME66 shotgun microphone with K6 power module and a Marantz PMD661 MKII audio recorder at a 96 kHz sampling frequency and a 16-bit amplitude resolution.
